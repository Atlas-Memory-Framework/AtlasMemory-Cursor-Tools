# Skill Spec: Define Problem

## Purpose
Convert a vague idea into a crisp problem statement with measurable success criteria and explicit scope boundaries.

## When to use
- User asks to start planning or says "define the problem."
- Before any adversarial or technical planning loops.

## Inputs
- Feature idea or goal statement (1-3 sentences).
- Hard constraints (optional).
- Known stakeholders (optional).

## Outputs
- Problem statement (1-3 sentences).
- Success criteria (measurable, testable).
- Constraints (non-negotiables).
- Scope and anti-scope.
- Definitions / glossary for key terms.
- Decision boundaries (if a fork exists).
- Open questions (true unknowns only).

## Success criteria (gate: ProblemDefinitionComplete)
- Problem statement is specific and non-solutionized.
- At least 2 measurable success criteria.
- Explicit scope and anti-scope exist.
- At least 1 constraint or stated "none."
- Any fork is captured as a decision boundary.

## Steps
1) Restate the user goal neutrally.
2) Identify missing problem details.
3) Propose candidate success criteria.
4) Capture constraints, scope, anti-scope.
5) Surface decision boundaries (A/B/C if needed).
6) Output the final problem definition block.

## Plan artifact updates
- Write a "Problem Definition" section (new).
- Append Decision Log entries for accepted boundaries.
- Record misunderstandings and clarifications as brief notes.

## UX rules
- Do not move on until success criteria are measurable.
- If the user provides weak confirmations, ask for specifics.
