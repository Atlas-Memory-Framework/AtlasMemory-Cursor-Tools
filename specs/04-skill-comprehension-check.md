# Skill Spec: Comprehension Check

## Purpose
Ensure the user genuinely understands the technical plan, tradeoffs, and risks.

## When to use
- After Technical Planning, before Reviews.
- After Reviews if material changes were made.

## Inputs
- Technical Plan draft (integration points, failure modes, invariants, NFRs).
- Known decision boundaries.

## Outputs
- Short user explanation of the plan in their own words.
- Confirmation of key tradeoffs and risks.
- Identified misunderstandings and corrections.

## Success criteria
- User restates the core approach correctly.
- User names at least 2 key risks and 1 mitigation.
- User acknowledges at least 1 tradeoff or alternative.

## Method
1) Ask the user to summarize the plan in their own words.
2) Ask 2-3 targeted questions about risks/invariants.
3) Present a forced-choice A/B/C question for a key decision.
4) Correct misunderstandings and update the plan.

## Plan artifact updates
- Record misunderstandings and corrections.
- Update Technical Plan sections if clarifications change intent.
