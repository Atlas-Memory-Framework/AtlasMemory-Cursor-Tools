# Planning Framework (legacy alias for /plan)

## Quick Start
Use the `/plan` workflow and the SSOT template at `.cursor/skills/plan/reference.md`.

## Rules
- All planning outputs live in the current plan artifact.
- Use the /plan validators and planning reviews before approval.
- Do not use the legacy plan template in this file.

## Additional Resources
- New workflow: `.cursor/skills/plan/`
- SSOT template: `.cursor/skills/plan/reference.md`
