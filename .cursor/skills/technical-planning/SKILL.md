# /technical-planning

## Purpose
Translate the Design into a technical plan grounded in the current system and aligned with risks, constraints, and NFRs. Run as a sub-agent and return a draft section to the orchestrator; do not write the plan artifact directly.

## Ownership
- Edit only the `## Technical Plan` section in the plan template.
- Do not modify other sections except updating Risks/Assumptions/Tests when needed.

## Inputs
- Problem Definition
- Challenge Artifacts
- Context Snapshot (if available)
- Constraints, NFRs, and decision log

## Required outputs (Technical Plan)
- Named integration points (interfaces, APIs, data contracts).
- Proposed architecture changes and integration steps.
- Failure modes per integration point.
- Explicit invariants and non-changes.
- NFR alignment (perf/security/privacy/cost/operability).
- Risks/assumptions/tests updated to reflect technical reality.
 - Draft section content for `## Technical Plan`

## Sub-agent output contract
Return a single block in this shape:

```md
DraftSection:
<exact section content for ## Technical Plan (must include the section header)>

Checklist:
- <criterion>: Pass | Fail

Questions:
- <if blocked>

Notes:
- <optional risks/assumptions/tests updates>
```

## Malformed output handling
- If you cannot produce the exact section header or required fields, return `Questions` explaining what is missing and leave `DraftSection` as `N/A`.

## Success criteria (gate: TechnicalClarity)
- Integration points are explicit and named.
- Failure modes exist for each integration point.
- Risks/assumptions/tests are updated and consistent.
- Invariants are listed and respected.
- NFRs are addressed or explicitly deferred with DR entry.

## Process
1) Identify integration points and named interfaces.
2) Describe architecture changes and sequencing.
3) Enumerate failure modes per integration point.
4) Update risks/assumptions/tests to match the plan.
5) Confirm invariants and non-changes.
6) Check NFR alignment and document tradeoffs.

## Output template
Use this exact structure in `## Technical Plan`:

```md
## Technical Plan
### Integration Points
- ...

### Proposed Architecture Changes
- ...

### Failure Modes (per integration point)
- ...

### Invariants / Non-Changes
- ...

### NFRs alignment
- ...
```

## UX rules (no "go read the plan")
- If you need user confirmation on a technical choice or integration point, paste the relevant excerpt(s) in the chat response (interfaces/integration points, failure modes, key risks).
- Summarize what changed and what decision (if any) is needed, without requiring the user to open the plan artifact.
