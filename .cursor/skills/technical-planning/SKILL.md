# /technical-planning

## Purpose
Translate the Design into a technical approach grounded in the current system.

## Outputs (write to Design + Challenge Artifacts)
- System Fit / Integration Points with named interfaces.
- Proposed architecture changes and integration steps.
- Edge cases and failure modes per integration point.
- Update risks/assumptions/tests to match technical reality.
- Explicit invariants and non-changes.
- Ensure Non-Functional Requirements are consistent with the proposed technical approach (perf/security/privacy/cost/operability).
