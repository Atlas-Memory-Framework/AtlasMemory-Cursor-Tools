description: Orchestrate the /plan workflow to create or update the current plan artifact (autonamed by Cursor) as the design SSOT and implementation plan. Use when the user runs /plan, asks to create a plan, or wants to progress planning stages with validation and reviews.

# /plan Orchestrator

## Purpose
Create or update the current plan artifact and move it through Problem, Feature, Technical, Implementation, and Reviews with deterministic validators and decision logging. Section-owner skills run as sub-agents and return drafts; the orchestrator is the only writer and runs the Q/A loop inline with the user.

## Core rules
- The SSOT is the current plan artifact; do not assume a fixed filename.
- **SSOT selection is a hard lock**:
  - **SSOT Lock precedence**:
    - If the user referenced any plan via `@path` in the last user message, **that wins** over thread context.
    - If multiple plans are referenced, you MUST ask the user to pick exactly one before proceeding (single-select).
  - Treat a plan as the SSOT only if:
    - the user explicitly provided it in this conversation (pasted content or referenced via `@path`), OR
    - `/plan` created it earlier in this same run.
  - Do NOT implicitly adopt a plan just because it exists in the workspace or happens to be open in the editor.
- **SSOT Echo (required)**: after SSOT is selected, print `SSOT = <path>` in chat before doing any plan work.
- **No-new-plan invariant**: if SSOT is set, do NOT create a new plan artifact unless the user explicitly requests “new plan”.
- If no explicit in-conversation plan artifact is provided, create a new plan doc from `reference.md` and immediately echo it as SSOT.
- Workflow order is fixed: Problem -> Feature -> Technical -> Implementation -> Reviews.
- Hard rule: `/problem-definition` and `/critical-ideation` are Q/A gated before advancing; run the Q/A loop inline with the user and only when the checklist fails or `Questions` is non-empty.
- **No gate flips without evidence**: before changing any of `Status`, `CurrentStage`, or any Gate Results, include a short checklist in chat stating:
  - which section(s) changed, and
  - why the validator now passes (what evidence/fields were added/clarified).
- Hard rule: plan artifact writes are done only by the orchestrator.
- Decision boundaries require A/B/C options and a Decision Log entry.
- Preserve user agency via decision boundaries + dispositions. Do not "auto-approve" ambiguous decisions.

## On each /plan invocation
1) Determine SSOT using the SSOT Lock precedence rules above.
2) If multiple plan artifacts were referenced, stop and ask the user to select exactly one (single-select) before doing any work.
3) If missing (no SSOT could be selected):
   - Ask for the feature idea / goal statement (1-2 sentences) and any hard constraints (optional).
   - Create a new plan doc using the template in `reference.md`.
4) Echo SSOT in chat: `SSOT = <path>`.
5) Determine `CurrentStage`.
6) Run validators in stage order up to the current stage.
7) Route to the first failing gate and call the owner skill as a sub-agent to produce a draft section. Provide any known agent roster or `## Context Snapshot` so ownership can be assigned correctly.
8) Run the human Q/A loop inline with the user using the gate's mode (see map below) when:
   - the validator fails, OR
   - `Questions` is non-empty, OR
   - you are moving into/through **TechnicalClarity** and you have not yet run at least one `mode=comprehension` checkpoint in this /plan invocation, OR
   - you are moving into/through **PlanReadiness** and you have not yet run at least one `mode=comprehension` checkpoint in this /plan invocation.
   Keep these checkpoints lightweight (2–3 targeted questions + one scope/ownership confirmation).
9) Re-run the owner sub-agent as needed until the gate passes.
10) Orchestrator writes the accepted output into the plan section.
11) Re-run the affected validator.
12) Advance stage only when its gate passes.
13) Update `Status`, `CurrentStage`, and any Gate Results only after providing the “no gate flips without evidence” checklist in chat.
    - Do not set `Status: Approved` unless `PlanStateSanity` passes.
14) Reviews stage only: run planning reviews, then auto-remediate findings that are purely clarity/structure improvements and do not change decisions.
    - **No paper reviews**: after any remediation or other material plan edits, regenerate reviews (or re-run the same review agents) so `PlanningReviewsComplete` reflects the updated document.
    - If reviews are stale (plan changed since last review run), `PlanningReviewsComplete` MUST be `Fail` until re-run.
15) Repeat the review -> remediation loop until findings are resolved, deduped as ignorable/non-relevant, or no new findings appear.
16) Only surface findings to the user when they require human agency (policy/compliance/cost/trust boundaries, decision boundaries, external source approval, contradictions with explicit assumptions/SSOT, or remediation target is `Unknown`). Ask for A/R/D only for this reduced set.
17) Hard rule: do not set `Status: Approved` or `PlanningReviewsComplete: Pass` if any human-agency items remain unresolved. Stop and request dispositions first.

## Validators (deterministic)
- ProblemDefinitionComplete: problem statement, measurable success criteria, constraints, scope/anti-scope, decision boundaries. Must be Q/A gated; inline loop only when needed.
- FeatureClarity: evaluation criteria, assumptions/tests, ranked risks with status, alternatives rejected, >=1 failure mode. Must be Q/A gated after critical-ideation; inline loop only when needed.
- TechnicalClarity: integration points named, failure modes per integration point, risks/assumptions updated, invariants respected.
- PlanReadiness (presence + structure + evidence; not “looks complete”):
  - **PlanTier: Lite (minimum)**:
    - file deltas exist and include explicit owner and rationale
    - workstreams include dependencies, merge points, and owned files
    - phases include evidence-based exit criteria and at least minimal build-time gates
    - test matrix includes “where it runs” (CI vs local vs deployed)
    - rollout includes rollback trigger + rollback steps
  - **PlanTier: Full (execution-grade, deterministic)**:
    - **agent roster exists** (owner -> responsibilities mapping) in `## Implementation Plan`
    - every workstream has explicit fields: `Owner`, `Depends on`, `Review gates`, `Merge point`
    - every phase has explicit fields: `Owner(s)`, `Depends on`, `Exit criteria (evidence)`, `Gates (named)`
    - **gate definitions exist** (named gates like `G-CI-Unit`, `G-DEPLOY-Smoke`) and each includes:
      - where it runs (CI | Local | Deployed)
      - entrypoint/command (or named test runner target)
      - what “green” means
    - each merge point/phase references gate names (or includes concrete commands/entrypoints)
    - test plan includes “where it runs” (CI vs deployed) explicitly, not implied
    - dependency sanity: if any workstream/phase declares `Depends on`, the phase ordering does not contradict it (no backwards dependency)
    - no placeholder language in gates (e.g., “run smoke tests”) without naming the gate(s) and where/how they run
    - the following “hard questions” MUST be decided or DR-deferred with trigger (PlanTier: Full):
      - migration tooling (Alembic vs raw SQL)
      - cutover criteria (when fallback is removed)
      - cache staleness policy (TTL default/max; invalidation yes/no)
      - Tier B2 onboarding readiness (provisioning/active status & 503 behavior)
- PlanStateSanity (blocks false “Approved/Execution”):
  - Do NOT allow `Status: Approved` or `CurrentStage: Build/Execution` if:
    - any gate is not `Pass`, OR
    - `Open questions` contains any item with `Status: Open` (or missing Status), OR
    - ambiguity markers remain in critical areas (Problem/Technical/Implementation/Decision Log), including: `TBD`, `to be decided`, `choose later`, `or decide later`
      - unless the ambiguity is explicitly captured as a Decision boundary (A/B/C) or a DR-backed Defer with a trigger.
- PlanningReviewsComplete: required reviews done with dispositions logged; expert-tech either done or N/A with rationale.
  - **Stale review detection (mechanical)**:
    - Each required review block MUST include a refreshed stamp in one of these canonical forms:
      - `Refreshed: YYYY-MM-DD` (preferred), OR
      - `(refreshed YYYY-MM-DD)` (legacy, allowed for backward compatibility)
    - If no refreshed stamp is present for any required review, treat reviews as stale -> gate fails.
    - If plan `LastUpdated` is later than any required review’s refreshed stamp, treat reviews as stale -> gate fails.
    - Only pass when required reviews are refreshed for the current plan state.

## Gate -> owner skill map (sub-agents)
- ProblemDefinitionComplete -> `/problem-definition`
- FeatureClarity -> `/critical-ideation`
- TechnicalClarity -> `/technical-planning`
- PlanReadiness -> `/implementation-planning`
- PlanningReviewsComplete -> `/planning-reviews`

## Gate -> Q/A loop mode map (inline)
- ProblemDefinitionComplete -> `qa-loop mode=default`
- FeatureClarity -> `qa-loop mode=default`
- TechnicalClarity -> `qa-loop mode=comprehension` (must run at least once per /plan invocation when moving into/through this gate)
- PlanReadiness -> `qa-loop mode=comprehension` (must run at least once per /plan invocation when moving into/through this gate)
- PlanningReviewsComplete -> `qa-loop mode=disposition`

## Review auto-remediation routing
- Problem -> `/problem-definition`
- Feature -> `/critical-ideation`
- Technical -> `/technical-planning`
- Implementation -> `/implementation-planning`
- Context Snapshot -> `/implementation-planning`
- Decision Log -> orchestrator updates decision boundary options; if unclear, ask the user.

## Human-agency definition (operational)
Human-agency items MUST be explicitly decided by the user (use structured questions when possible) and recorded as a Decision Log entry or an explicit “user decision: …” note. Human-agency includes:
- Cost targets that require SKU/region assumptions
- Retention/compliance commitments (e.g., multi-year audit retention)
- Routing boundary decisions (deny-by-default vs fallback behavior)
- Any change that alters the trust boundary or data-handling policy
- Security/privacy posture changes, data residency commitments, or auth boundary changes

## Patch strategy (required)
- Only replace the owned section between its header and the next header.
- Do not modify other sections.
- If the section is missing, insert it under the expected header in the template order.

## Malformed output definition (flexible mapping)
- Acceptable: content is semantically mappable to the owned section even if formatting differs from the template.
- Malformed: introduces new top-level sections, omits required fields for the gate, or conflicts with an existing section header.
- If malformed, do not write to the plan. Ask the user whether to (a) drop the extra content, (b) map it into the closest section, or (c) re-run the sub-agent with clarifications.
## Mapping heuristics (brief)
- Map extra bullets into the closest subsection by label match (e.g., "Risks" -> Risks/Assumptions/Tests).
- If no clear match, hold in `Questions` and ask the user.

## Failure behavior
- If a sub-agent output fails validation, ask the user for clarifications and re-run the sub-agent.
- If the Q/A loop cannot close the gap, set `NextRequiredUserAction`, keep the gate at `N/A`, and stop.

## Minimal plan policy (anti-overwrite)
- Keep sections as short as possible while still passing the gate.
- Prefer bullets over prose.
- If a section can be satisfied in 3-5 bullets, do not expand it.

## Context handling
- Each sub-agent is responsible for collecting minimal necessary context for its section.
- The Implementation Planning sub-agent owns the `## Context Snapshot` section and should fill any missing context required for execution, including the agent roster if not already captured.
- Only hard-block when missing context makes a gate unsafe to pass.

## Sub-skills used (run as sub-agents unless noted)
- `/problem-definition` -> sub-agent, Q/A gated (inline loop when needed)
- `/critical-ideation` -> sub-agent, Q/A gated (inline loop when needed)
- `/technical-planning` -> sub-agent, Q/A gated (inline loop when needed)
- `/implementation-planning` -> sub-agent, Q/A gated (inline loop when needed)
- `/planning-reviews` -> inline or sub-agent, Q/A gated (inline loop when needed)

## Output
- Patch the current plan artifact only.
- Reply with a short summary of changes, gate status, and any required user decision.
